# Tic-Tac-Toe Game with PyQt5

This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game created using PyQT5. The game has two playing modes: two-player mode and versus computer mode. 
The goal of the game is to place three marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

## Usage
To start the game, simply run the tic_tac_toe.py file in your Python environment.

When the game starts, you will be presented with a menu that allows you to select the game mode. Choose the mode you want to play:

* 2 player mode: In this mode, two players take turns marking the spaces in a 3x3 grid. The first player to get three marks in a row wins the game.
* Vs computer mode: In this mode, you play against the computer. The computer will make its move automatically after you make yours.

Once you have selected the game mode, the game board will appear. To make a move, simply click on an empty square on the board.

If a player wins, the game will end and a score will be updated. You can start a new game by clicking the "Play again" button.
